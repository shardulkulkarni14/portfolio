  <p><strong>January 2024 - Present</strong></p>
  <p>Developing a comprehensive video analysis system for object tracking and activity analysis across multiple camera views in a healthcare environment.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Created a custom YOLO object detection model for the hospital environment.</li>
    <li>Implemented single-camera tracking algorithms as a foundation for future multi-perspective tracking, addressing occlusions and variable lighting.</li>
    <li>Designed a report generation module with visualizations like heatmaps.</li>
    <li>Ensured data security and privacy compliance with healthcare standards.</li>
    <li>Built a multi camera object tracking prototype for healthcare environment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Object Tracking, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, YOLO.</p>
