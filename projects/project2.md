  <p><strong>May 2023 - September 2023</strong></p>
  <p>Implemented attribution methods including GradCAM, SmoothgradCAM++, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM on models like ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducted occlusion-based perturbation and adversarial noise assessment to identify vulnerabilities in attribution methods.</li>
    <li>Generated over 16,000 perturbed images from 113 samples for robust experiments.</li>
    <li>Developed and integrated evaluation metrics such as Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Earth Moverâ€™s Distance, and Normalized Scanpath Saliency.</li>
    <li>Verified vulnerabilities using the Captum library and compared results with state-of-the-art metrics.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Deep Learning, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow.</p>
