**May 2023 - September 2023**

Implemented attribution methods including GradCAM, SmoothgradCAM++, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM on models like ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3.
- Conducted occlusion-based perturbation and adversarial noise assessment to identify vulnerabilities in attribution methods.
- Generated over 16,000 perturbed images from 113 samples for robust experiments.
- Developed and integrated evaluation metrics such as Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Earth Moverâ€™s Distance, and Normalized Scanpath Saliency.
- Verified vulnerabilities using the Captum library and compared results with state-of-the-art metrics.

**Technologies**: Deep Learning, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow.
